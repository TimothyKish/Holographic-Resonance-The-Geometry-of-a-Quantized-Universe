# 🔬 The Verification Suite
**Grand Slam Validation for the Kish Lattice Theory**

This folder contains the source code for the **Unified Monograph (v1.0)** and the **Python Verification Scripts** used to validate the geometric constants.

## 📂 Core Documents
* **`The_Kish_Lattice_Unified.pdf`**: The official published monograph (v1.0).
* **`The_Kish_Lattice_Unified.tex`**: The LaTeX source code for the monograph.

## 💻 The Simulations (Grand Slam)
We provide two versions of each verification script to demonstrate the "Agency Shift."

### 1. The Standard Model (`_no_agency.py`)
These scripts simulate the universe using the **Deterministic Baseline** ($16/\pi$). They solve the general magnitude of the problems (Vacuum Catastrophe, Proton Radius) but often leave a small "Quantum Gap."

### 2. The Kish Lattice (`_delta_agency.py`)
These scripts include the **Life Agency Offset** (`1.42e-7`), derived from the WMAP dipole anisotropy. This represents the "Friction of Life" moving through the grid. When applied, the calculations align with observed reality to distinct precision.

| Problem | Script Pair | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Vacuum Catastrophe** | `vacuum_catastrophe_...` | Resolves the $10^{120}$ discrepancy in vacuum energy density. |
| **The Proton Radius** | `proton_radius_...` | Solves the 4% gap between Electronic and Muonic hydrogen measurements. |
| **The Hubble Tension** | `hubble_tension_...` | Harmonizes the Early Universe ($67$) vs Late Universe ($73$) expansion rates. |
| **JWST Galaxies** | `jwst_nodes_...` | Explains the "Impossible" size of early galaxies via lattice scaffolding. |
| **LIGO Noise** | `kish_monte_carlo.py` | The original noise analysis script from Chapter A. |

### 🎛️ The Sandbox
* **`kish_master_equation_sandbox.py`**: The visual proof tool. Run this to generate the histograms showing the "Agency Shift" in real-time.
