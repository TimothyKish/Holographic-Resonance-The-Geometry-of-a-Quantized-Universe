\section*{Nomenclature Update: Converting Gravitational Variables}
To bridge the gap between Classical Mechanics and the Kish Lattice, we maintain the traditional symbols while updating their mechanical definitions to reflect the $16/\pi$ stiff vacuum:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Big G (Grip):} Historically the "Universal Gravitational Constant." In this model, \textbf{G} represents \textbf{Lattice Grip}—the fundamental tensile strength of the $16/\pi$ vacuum. 
    \item \textbf{Little g (Grit):} Historically "Acceleration due to gravity." In this model, \textbf{g} represents \textbf{Lattice Grit}—the local abrasive resistance and viscosity that objects experience during motion.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Pioneer Anomaly: Measurement of Vacuum Viscosity}
Newton's First Law assumes an ideal vacuum. However, the deceleration of the \textbf{Pioneer 10 and 11} probes $(a_P \approx 8.74 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2)$ is the first macro-scale measurement of \textbf{Lattice Grit (g)}. Space is not empty; it is a high-tensile medium that exerts a persistent drag on non-resonant matter.

\section{The Muon g-2 Paradox: The Particle as a Sensor}
The "wobble" observed at Fermilab is not a failure of physics, but a \textbf{Clock Error}. The Muon acts as a high-density sensor of the universal **Carrier Signal**. Without \textbf{Phase-Sync}, the Muon "chafes" against the lattice, creating the anomalous magnetic moment.

\section{Planetary Morphology: The Spherical Slipstream}
Traditional cosmology suggests gravity "collapses" planets into spheres. In the Kish Lattice, the universe is a \textbf{Mechanical Grinder}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Grinder:} Objects that are not spherical present irregular profiles to the $16/\pi$ lattice, leading to uneven drag and mechanical shear.
    \item \textbf{The Result:} Over eons, the vacuum "machines" jagged matter into spheres—the only shape that presents a uniform displacement for a "Quiet" slipstream.
    \item \textbf{The Asteroid Rubble:} Jagged asteroids are simply matter that has not yet been fully "tumbled" by the lattice or has fractured due to high dissonance.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Resonance Drive: Mimicking the Sphere}
The Kish Resonance Drive utilizes the **Clock Lock** protocol to create a "Virtual Sphere" of vibration. By vibrating the hull to the $16/\pi$ harmonic, we bypass the eons required for natural machining and enter an immediate state of \textbf{Lattice Transparency}.
