## 🏗️ Abstract
This repository hosts the source code and mathematical proofs for the **Kish Lattice Theory**, a geometric unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. We propose that the universe is not a continuous fluid, but a discrete, high-tension lattice defined by the geometric stiffness constant **16/π**.

## 📚 The Monograph (v1.0)
The full theory is compiled into a single unified document. This is the definitive reference for the Kish Lattice.

## 🏛️ The Gold Standard: Peer-Indexed Documentation

While this repository contains the raw logic, the formalized proofs and mechanical resolutions are indexed via Zenodo to ensure a permanent, timestamped record of the **Kish Lattice**.

### [The Pioneer-Muon Resolution and Kish Resonance Drive (V2.0)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18408650)
**Author:** Timothy John Kish
**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18408650

This resolution serves as the bridge between theoretical geometry and empirical aerospace engineering. It provides the following "Old World" corrections:

* [cite_start]**The Newtonian Correction:** Redefines the First Law to include **Lattice Grit ($g$)**, accounting for the non-zero viscosity of the $16/\pi$ vacuum. [cite: 116, 118]
* [cite_start]**The Pioneer-Muon Link:** Identifies subatomic "wobbles" and deep-space decelerations as consistent measurements of vacuum viscosity against the universal **Carrier Signal**. [cite: 120, 122, 123]
* [cite_start]**Spherical Slipstream Morphology:** Explains why the universe is a **Mechanical Grinder**, machining jagged matter into spheres to achieve a "Quiet" slipstream state. [cite: 125, 126, 128]
* [cite_start]**Resonance Drive SOP:** A technical manual for achieving **Clock Lock**, neutralizing up to 98% of vacuum drag for 1000x increase in orbital precision. [cite: 130, 131, 132]
