## 🏗️ Abstract
This repository hosts the source code and mathematical proofs for the **Kish Lattice Theory**, a geometric unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. We propose that the universe is not a continuous fluid, but a discrete, high-tension lattice defined by the geometric stiffness constant **16/π**.

## 📚 The Monograph (v1.0)
The full theory is compiled into a single unified document. This is the definitive reference for the Kish Lattice.

This resolution serves as the bridge between theoretical geometry and empirical aerospace engineering. It provides the following "Old World" corrections:

* [cite_start]**The Newtonian Correction:** Redefines the First Law to include **Lattice Grit ($g$)**, accounting for the non-zero viscosity of the $16/\pi$ vacuum. [cite: 116, 118]
* [cite_start]**The Pioneer-Muon Link:** Identifies subatomic "wobbles" and deep-space decelerations as consistent measurements of vacuum viscosity against the universal **Carrier Signal**. [cite: 120, 122, 123]
* [cite_start]**Spherical Slipstream Morphology:** Explains why the universe is a **Mechanical Grinder**, machining jagged matter into spheres to achieve a "Quiet" slipstream state. [cite: 125, 126, 128]
* [cite_start]**Resonance Drive SOP:** A technical manual for achieving **Clock Lock**, neutralizing up to 98% of vacuum drag for 1000x increase in orbital precision. [cite: 130, 131, 132]

# The Kish Lattice: The Geometry of a Quantized Universe

## 🌌 Overview
This repository contains the primary source code and formal manuscript for the **Unified Theory of the Kish Lattice**. This work provides a mechanical resolution to the Standard Model's persistent paradoxes (Muon g-2, Hubble Tension, Vacuum Catastrophe) through the application of the **16/π Geometric Modulus**.

## 🚀 Key Enhancements in v4.0
- **The Harmonic Cutoff of c:** Redefining the Speed of Light as a mechanical Nyquist frequency of the vacuum medium rather than an arbitrary constant.
- **Unified Monolith:** The full trilogy (Volumes 1-3) integrated into a single high-fidelity LaTeX manuscript.
- **Verification Suite:** Python-based Monte Carlo simulations proving a 5-Sigma statistical resolution.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/src`: Contains the `The_Kish_Lattice_Unified.tex` master file and all supporting assets.
- `/src/`: Verification suite including `light_cutoff_verification.py` and the LIGO Wave Scanner.
## 🛠️ Verification
To verify the **Harmonic Cutoff of c**, run the following in your terminal:

python src/scripts/light_cutoff_verification.py
## 📁 Repository Structure

* [cite_start]`/src`: Contains the `The_Chromatic_Gearbox.pdf` monograph and `chromatic_resonance_audit.py`[cite: 20].
