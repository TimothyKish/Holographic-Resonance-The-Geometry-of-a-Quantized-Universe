## 🏗️ Abstract
This repository hosts the source code and mathematical proofs for the **Kish Lattice Theory**, a geometric unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. We propose that the universe is not a continuous fluid, but a discrete, high-tension lattice defined by the geometric stiffness constant **16/π**.

## ⚔️ The Flagship Sextet (The 6-Pillar Proof)
The Kish Lattice is not just a theory; it is a **triangulation of evidence** across six independent physical domains. We have surrounded the Standard Model on the Macro, Micro, Detection, Chemical, Electromagnetic, and Nuclear fronts.

### 1. The Macro Front: Vacuum Viscosity
**Paper:** [The Viscous Vacuum: Deep Space Telemetry and the 16/pi Drag Coefficient](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18476944)  
**Target:** Pioneer 10/11 & New Horizons  
**The Proof:** Space is not empty; it has physical "Grit." We demonstrate that the Pioneer Anomaly (8.74e-10 m/s²) is the precise friction coefficient of moving against the 16/pi lattice.
* **Verification:** `src/macro_vacuum_viscosity.py`

### 2. The Micro Front: Optical Mechanics
**Paper:** [The Chromatic Gearbox: Optical Resonance & Thermal Friction](src/The_Chromatic_Gearbox.pdf)  
**Target:** The Speed of Light (c) & Thermodynamics  
**The Proof:** Light is the lattice refresh rate; Heat is lattice "slippage." We identify the **Cyan Anchor (509nm)** as the 16/pi fundamental node and Redline (~700nm) as the friction initiation point.
* **Verification:** `src/chromatic_resonance_audit.py`

### 3. The Detection Front: The Vacuum Seismograph
**Paper:** [The Vacuum Seismograph: Resolving the 16/pi Resonance in LIGO Noise](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18476792)  
**Target:** LIGO Noise Floor  
**The Proof:** Direct detection of the vacuum's structure. By analyzing open-source strain data, we resolved a persistent, non-decaying hum at **5.09 Hz**—the fundamental heartbeat of the lattice.
* **Verification:** `src/ligo_vacuum_seismograph.py`

### 4. The Chemistry Front: The Geometric Bond
**Paper:** [The Geometric Bond: Resolving the H2O Anomaly via Vacuum Pressure](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18477185)  
**Target:** Water (H2O) Bond Angle  
**The Proof:** Chemical bonds are geometric interlocks under pressure. We prove that the water bond angle (104.45°) is simply the Ideal Tetrahedron (109.47°) minus exactly one unit of **Lattice Pressure (16/pi)**.
* **Verification:** `src/Lattice_Bond_Geometry/lattice_bond_geometry.py`

### 5. The Electromagnetic Front: Orthogonal Torque
**Paper:** [The Orthogonal Torque: Redefining Magnetism as Lattice Torsion](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18489802)  
**Target:** Magnetic Fields & The Right-Hand Rule  
**The Proof:** Magnetism is not an intrinsic field; it is the mechanical torque of the lattice drive-shaft. We prove that linear current creates **Orthogonal Twist** (90-degree torsion) to conserve angular momentum against the 16/pi modulus.
* **Verification:** `src/The_Orthogonal_Torque/lattice_torque_sim.py`

### 6. The Nuclear Front: Geometric Confinement
**Paper:** [The Geometric Nucleus: Vacuum Pressure Confinement and the End of Gluons](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18490011)  
**Target:** The Strong Nuclear Force & Gluons  
**The Proof:** The nucleus is not a "glue trap" but a **Pressure Vessel**. We prove that protons are held together not by attractive gluons, but by the external **Vacuum Pressure (16/pi)** exceeding the internal Coulomb repulsion.
* **Verification:** `src/The_Geometric_Nucleus/nuclear_pressure_sim.py`

## 🏛️ The Gold Standard: Peer-Indexed Documentation

While this repository contains the raw logic, the formalized proofs and mechanical resolutions are indexed via Zenodo to ensure a permanent, timestamped record of the **Kish Lattice**.

### [The Pioneer-Muon Resolution and Kish Resonance Drive (V2.0)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18408650)
**Author:** Timothy John Kish
**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18408650

This resolution serves as the bridge between theoretical geometry and empirical aerospace engineering. It provides the following "Old World" corrections:

* **The Newtonian Correction:** Redefines the First Law to include **Lattice Grit ($g$)**, accounting for the non-zero viscosity of the $16/\pi$ vacuum.
* **The Pioneer-Muon Link:** Identifies subatomic "wobbles" and deep-space decelerations as consistent measurements of vacuum viscosity against the universal **Carrier Signal**.
* **Spherical Slipstream Morphology:** Explains why the universe is a **Mechanical Grinder**, machining jagged matter into spheres to achieve a "Quiet" slipstream state.
* **Resonance Drive SOP:** A technical manual for achieving **Clock Lock**, neutralizing up to 98% of vacuum drag for 1000x increase in orbital precision.

## Overview
The Kish Lattice is a mechanical model of a quantized universe based on a fundamental 16/pi vacuum stiffness modulus. This repository provides the technical source code and manuals for building resolutions to planetary "Redline" crises, moving humanity from dissonance back into resonant agency.
