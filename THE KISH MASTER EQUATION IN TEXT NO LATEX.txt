(Holographic Resonance Unified Field Theory)

Sum( δ(E - E_n) ) ≈ [ V_Univ / (2π ℏ)³ ] + (1 / πk) * Sum(p) Sum(m) [ (ln p / p^(m/2)) * (e^(-Δτ) / Damping) * cos( (E/E_0) * [16/π] * m ln p ) ]

THE ROSETTA STONE (LEGEND)
[ V_Univ / (2π ℏ)³ ]: The Stage.

This represents the Vacuum Volume. It is the empty room before the music starts.

[ 16/π ]: The Gear Ratio.

This is the Geometric Stiffness of the Universe. It is the "Tuning Peg" that aligns the vibration to the sphere packing of space.

[ ln p ]: The Metronome.

The Natural Log of Prime Numbers. This sets the rhythm of the universe (2, 3, 5, 7...).

[ e^(-Δτ) / Damping ]: The Friction.

This is the Decay term. It represents Entropy or "Lattice Drag." If this is high, the object falls apart. If it is low, the object is stable (like Gold).

[ cos(...) ]: The String.

The Cosine function creates the Standing Wave (the Song) that we perceive as matter.

Theoretical claims are common, so the Python validation script is on GitHub. The reader can run it themselves to see the curve flatten instantly with Tully-Fisher relation without fitting parameters:
